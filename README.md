# ShadowGuard Lite

A Rust-based reimplementation of classic Unix login tools (`login`, `passwd`, `adduser`) focused on memory safety, maintainability, and one-to-one behavior fidelity.

## Getting Started

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

## Project Goal

- Replicate the behavior of existing tools without feature changes
- Use Rust to provide memory safety and modern tooling
- Modular, tested, and beginner-friendly

## Status

- ✅ Initial project structure
- ✅ Dummy login entry point
- ✅ Basic test setup

More coming soon...
